## About

This project was an exciting dive into the world of managing finances through a Flutter-based Expense Tracker App. It allowed me to exercise my development skills by implementing essential features for expense management and enhancing the user experience with dynamic visualizations.

## Dart Server

To enhance the functionality of the Expense Tracker App, I set up a local Dart server. This server acted as a backend, enabling permanent data storage and management. It added a backend twist to my mobile development journey, showcasing my versatility in both frontend and backend technologies.
